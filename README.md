# Spaceball

<h1>Project Description:</h1>
<h4>What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This project is about a baseball's journey from earth to space. It is our interpretation of the more ironic end of the world. At the beginning, the baseball player hits the ball with all his strength and the ball travels beyond the earth's atmosphere, after which the ball collides with a meteor. Then, pieces of the meteor head toward earth and the player is horrified to witness the coming end of the world. While working on the comic, our goal was to create an experience for the viewers as if they were the main character. Some parts of our comic like "Click me" from the first scene create this feeling of central role in the storyline.</p>

<h1>Process:</h1>
<h4>How did you go about implementing the concept. Describe your role and what your contribution was.</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Designers:</b> Tomiris & Zhaniya</p>
<p>Basically, the designers were responsible for the visuals of the comic book. Using Sketchbook, the artists drew the panels and other elements of the comics. Each object in the pictures of the comic was drawn on different layers, so that it was easy for the developers to add animations and various features. The details were hand-drawn and interpreted by the designers to fit the overall concept of the comic. For instance, the inspiration for the last panel was an Edvard Munch painting called "Scream," with added elements of our comic book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Developers:</b> Tim & Fahad</p>
<p>The developers worked on building the website, creating animations for the comic book panels. They used html, css and java script to create animations for each of the panels. Interactivity is also included on the main page, so the website is not static. Developers created animations for almost every part of the story, which makes the comic more dynamic.</p>

<h1>Reflection/Evaluation:</h1>
<h4>This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Originally, we planned to use parallax for the whole website, so that when one scrolls only the background changes and the ball remains static. Although, we found that it was very limiting for us to explore our artistic skills. In general, it was the right decision since it gave us more space for our creativity. In addition, we changed the plot of the story as we worked since we wanted to make the comic more interesting. All in all, we think a great job was done and we are satisfied with the result.</p>
